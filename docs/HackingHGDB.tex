\secrel{Hacking \hgdb}\secdown

We will not participate in the development of \hgdb\note{this project too large
to spend lot of time on it}, but we will use it's sources to rebuild some .jars
in \seco\ from source, and we need some extra tools like \hgv. 

\secrel{Clone sources}

\lstx{\prog{git clone} from \github\ (read-only over
\file{https://})}{src/hgdbclone.rc}{sh}

\secrel{Build using \file{Makefile}}

And in this point I see then we still can do some fixes: build \hgdb\ using
\make: \href{https://github.com/hypergraphdb/hypergraphdb/issues/128}{issue128}

\lstx{fork \hgdb\ and replace local source tree}{src/hgdbsrc.rc}{sh}
